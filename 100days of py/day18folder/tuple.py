introduction to python Tuples:
what's a tuple?
this is a data type in python and are found in a parenthesis, which it's values are seperated by coma. (1, 3, 8)
comparing a tuple to list ie 
(1, 3, 8)
[1, 3, 8]
well just like what you could do with list same here but the big difference is that it'd carved in stonr.
that's to say you can't change it's value, making it {immutable} unlike like which is {mutble}

'''
my_tuple = (1, 2, 8)
# print(my_tuple[2])

# trying to change tuples value

# my_tuple[2] = 12
# print(my_tuple)

'''
since they act like a list, why then do we use tuple?
well this considered like a constnt in python, making it's values unchangeble

the only way to change a tuple is by converting it into a list
'''
# convert = list(my_tuple)
# convert[2] = 12
# print(convert)

# workig with turtle and tuple under colormode()


# we'll e with a package called colorgram.
# https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/
# search for this on Google. hirst spot painting


# Make a Spirograph
