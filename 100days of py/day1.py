# # python is a multipupose language.
# '''
# things you must be careful with while coding in python:
# 1. python being a high-level language and case sensitive.
# 2. be care with the way you use quote, do not use a quote for any function.
# 3. quotes are mainly meant for strings.
# python interpretation is line by line
# be careful with indentation error
# be careful with syntax error
# '''

# string methods
# Python outputting: strings
print("hello world")  
#back-flsah for new line of codea
print("hello same line\n Hello yes same line")
# string concatinator:
# three ways to do that
print("hello " + "Chinedum")
print("hello" + " Chinedum")
print("hello" + " " + "Chinedum")


# # input function
# print("Hello" + " " + input("whats is your name?\n "))
# # string length
# print(len( input("whats is your name")))


# Python Variable
# this simply means a memory location of a particular thing.
# helps us to reuse anything or value

# name = input("enter your name \n")
# print("Hello!", name)
# # excicerse: use variable and print a lenght of a user input
# a = 10
# b = a
# c = b

# print(a + b    + c )

# variable rules
'''
avoid adding space while naming a variable
its a good practice to name your variable accordin its duties
use underscore while naming your variable   
must not start with a number, rather laters, _, etc.
avoid using python functions in naming your variable
remember its case sensitive.

Excercise:
create a greating for your program.
ask the user to enter the city he/she grew up
ask them the name of their pet
combine the name of their city and pet and show their band name 
make sure the input cusor shows on a new line
'''

# # solution
# print("Welcome to the bank gereator")
# greatings = input("Enter a city you grew up ")
# pet_name = input("whats is your pet name? ")
# band_name = (greatings + " " + pet_name)
# print("Your bank name is",band_name)
